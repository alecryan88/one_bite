# One Bite Pizza Review Data Pipeline

An end-to-end data application to analyze pizza reviews.


## Architecture


## Overview
https://onebite.app/ is a mobile application created by Barstool Sports, a leading sports and pop culture media company. The mobile application allows users to review pizza restaurants in their area and give a short description of their experience along with a score (0-10). The review data is exposed via an API that can be downloaded freely without authentication. 

## Motivation
The reason I chose to do this project is to gain some experience using tools such as: Apache Airflow, DBT & Snowflake. I also wanted to showcase some SQL and Tableau skills that I've honed working as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst.
